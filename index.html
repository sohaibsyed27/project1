  <p>Hey, my name is Sohaib. I am a 5th year coterm student. I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Data Science.</p>
  <p>Through this website I hope you get to know me better. I have a mix of interests and hobbies.</p>
  <p>I was born in Toronto, Canada to Pakistani parents.</p>
  <p>We moved to Chicago when I was 4 years old and since then I have lived here. I strongly believe it is the greatest city in the U.S.</p>
